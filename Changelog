- improved ppswr() function: Replacing the for loop with a  call to findInterval() speeds up the function significantly. Thanks to Evan Althouse and Peter Frechtel from the MITRE Corporation for this improvement. An important side effect is that the notoriously slow (in some cases) sampford() function is speeded up too, since it repeatedly calls ppswr().
